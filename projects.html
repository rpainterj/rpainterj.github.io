			<p class="text--beta">I&rsquo;ve been at <a class="link--alpha" href="https://www.multitracks.com/">Multitracks.com</a> since March 2016.
				A small development and design team meant I got to step into a lot of different roles and touch
				our projects at several different points. 
			</p>
			<p class="text--beta">The majority of my work has been creating and styling the markup for new pages.
				I worked with the designers to build pixel-perfect, responsive pages that lived within our design system.
				This involved working on prototypes, building out animations and hover states, and creating a reusable,
				consistent CSS library that works across our site. I love digging into the CSS world and creating layouts
				and buttons that bring our designers' static comps to life.

			<p class="text--beta">The nature of our business demanded several types of interfaces, from splash pages to functional, 
				dashboard-type UI. I worked on media players, modals, search pages, and everything in between.

				I spearheaded the design and launch of a new support site for our customers.
				This took a bit of research to work in the Zendesk App Tools system and build a solution
				that could scale for four different sites (one for each language we support: English,
				Spanish, French, and Portuguese).

			<p class="text--beta">A lot of work involved working through the UX of downloading items, adding items to playlists.
				I worked closely with the back end team to communicate our data needs, sometimes jumping in the C# myself for easier
				tasks. When we updated our download behaviors and UI, I spent a good amount of time in Excel documenting behaviors.

			<p class="text--beta">My favorite part of the process was getting to help design the look and feel of the site.
